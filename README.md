# Academic Honesty
This repository contains the source code that I completed for the CS50x course offered by Harvard University. The purpose of this repository is to archive my work and showcase my learning. It is not meant to provide answers or encourage academic dishonesty for anyone who is taking the course now or in the future. If you are a current student of the course, please follow the course guidelines and do the assignments by yourself. You will learn more and feel more accomplished that way. ðŸ˜Š
